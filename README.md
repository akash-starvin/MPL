# MPL - A Volleyball Fantasy League

## Overview
MPL is a fantasy sports platform that allows users to play fantasy volleyball for a local league. 
It is a social networking application and fun game application. This application is based on volleyball leagues such as MPL (Milagres Premier League) held at Milagres College. 

It is just like playing volleyball match, but we won’t play directly. Here we will get to select match we want to participate, based on the selected match we will get to create a team of any 8 players in total from both the teams, having a maximum of 5 players from one team. 

In this application we will get real time score and player points updation. Points are assigned to each player based on their performance and based on the player points a leaderboard for the match and the season are generated. 

If a user’s team has the player whose points have been updated then team total will be updated and reflected on the leaderboard. Multiple users will create their own team of 8 players and whichever team gets the highest points against other teams will be considered as winner. 

This leader board is generated for every match as well as for the season which is a total of all the match leaderboards. It also provides a space for users to add comments to an ongoing match.
